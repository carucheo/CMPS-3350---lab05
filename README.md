# Cade and Everardo's English-to-Spanish Translator

This repository contains a very simple and barebones version of an English-to-Spanish translator using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

### Notes
- Base functionality entails entering an English word resulting in its Spanish translation.
- There is a very limited dataset of words that will be accurately translated and some that will not be translated at all.
- Attemps were made at a more efficient and accurate way of implementing translation. All attempts failed.
