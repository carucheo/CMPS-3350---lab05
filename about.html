        Hello, Spanglish is a word by word translator from English to Spanish. Because it
        is word by word, the grammar is not always correct. Due to limited time
        and the fact that Linguistics is hard. We also decided to input out own
        hand made data set because we could nor fine one that suited are needs.
    </p>
    <p>
        My second point, some words may not be provided and we apologize. We
        working day and night to have everysingle translation in every single dialect
        ...solo bromeo!
