    <p>
        Hello, Spanglish is a word by word translator from English to Spanish.
        The grammar may not always be correct due to time
        constraints and the fact that Linguistics is hard. We also decided to input
        our own limited data set because we could not find one that suited our needs.
    </p>
    <p>
        My second point, some words may not be provided and we apologize. We were
        working day and night to have every single translation in every single dialect
        ...solo bromeo!
    </p>
